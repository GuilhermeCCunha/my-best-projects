## Getting Started

Clone or download zip file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeCCunha/my-best-projects.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To use ng commands like ng new, ng serve, or ng generate, you must have the Angular CLI installed on your system.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@20.1.4
```
For more information, see https://angular.dev/cli/.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
# or
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
# or
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
